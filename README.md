Programming I Assignment 3

1.	Leonardo Fibonacci from Pisa was one of the greatest mathematicians of the middle ages. He is perhaps most famous for the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci numbers are the integer sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..., in which each item is formed by adding the 
previous two. An efficient way to output a series of numbers in the sequence is to the recurrence relation Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, with the first two numbers in the sequence F1 and F2 both defined as 1. Using this recurrence relation write an application that accepts N, where N>=1 from the user and displays the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The output should resemble the following; 

2.	Write a program that counts the number of digits in an integer entered by the user. The program should repeatedly ask for input and displays the number of digits the input integer has. The program output should resemble the following;
